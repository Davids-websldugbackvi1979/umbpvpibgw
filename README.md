I just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Uppercut, and honestly, if I had to describe the experience in a word, it’d be... whiplash. Like, seriously, what was that plunge I just took? One moment, I was sinking into my seat, trying to grasp what the heck the protagonist was contemplating amidst some existential crisis, and the next moment, BAM! Punches thrown left and right as if the storyline was at some family reunion with unresolved drama. Who thought existential angst and brawls mixed well?

And man, don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It felt like my playlist from 2009 just threw a tantrum. But hey, at least it kept me awake—especially during that third act when I was just about ready to crawl out of my own skin. I mean, are we supposed to feel sorry for him as he fights with literal fists? Like, I get it, it was a metaphor, probably, but maybe a text notification would've been nice for the brain cells trying to piece it together.

> Oh, and the visuals! At some point, they practically shoved neon lights in my pupils as if trying to brainwash me into liking the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. It was like entering a disco and discovering it's actually a circus. A neon circus. With a DJ and popcorn. You know that feeling when you go out for a quiet walk, but suddenly you're roped into a full-on carnival and you're like, How did I end up here? Same vibe.

Now let's spare a moment for the script. I'm not saying it was bad, but let's just say I've heard cats fighting in an alley make more coherent sense. And the romance subplot? Felt like someone threw it in last minute, like, Oh shoot, we forgot to dump in some romance! It’s like adding avocado to a sandwich that’s already packed with everything else, hoping it'd transform into something better.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int fightScene(int intensity) {
    if (intensity > 9000) {
        printf(Punch harder!);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Anyway, for reasons unknown, I'm still wired up about this insane movie. It's the kind of thing you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, then immediately want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie, just to pause and see if you actually saw what you think you saw. Like, give yourself a gift of confusion? I'll probably find myself 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it again sometime, even if it's just to throw side comments at my screen. Let's call it a guilty pleasure or an eye-rolling adventure ya can't quite peel away from.
